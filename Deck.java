/* DECK CLASS 
A class that creates a deck of cards specific to Old Maid where a Queen is removed from the deck. It has a constructor, a populate method, an add card  method, a peek method (which is like an accessor except it only looks at the top card), a draw card method, a deck shuffling method, and an isEmpty method that checks for whether or not the deck is empty.*/
